destination alpha or its opposite.}
  \item{"constant_color", "one_minus_constant_color",
  "constant_alpha", "one_minus_constant_alpha",
  "src_alpha_saturate"}{These are allowed, but to be useful
  they require other settings which \pkg{rgl} doesn't
  support.}
  }
  }
  \item{col}{An allowed abbreviation of \code{color}.}

}
\details{
  Values can be queried by specifying their names
in a character vector, e.g. \code{material3d("color")}.
The \code{rgl.material.names} variable contains the
full list of material names.
The \code{rgl.material.readonly} variable contains
the subset of material properties that are read-only
so they can be queried
but not set.
Currently there is only one:

\describe{
\item{isTransparent}{Is the current color transparent?}
}
  
  Only one side at a time can be culled.
  
  Object display colors are determined as follows:
\itemize{
\item{If \code{lit = FALSE}, an element of the \code{color} vector property is displayed without modification.  See documentation for individual objects for information on which element is chosen.}
\item{If \code{lit = TRUE}, the color is determined as follows.}
\enumerate{
\item{The color is set to the \code{emission} property
of the object. }
\item{For each defined light, the following are added:
\itemize{
\item{the product of the \code{ambient} color
of the light and the \code{ambient} color of the object is added.}
\item{the \code{color} of the
object is multiplied by the \code{diffuse} color
of the light and by a constant depending on
the angle between the surface and the direction to 
the light, and added.}
\item{the \code{specular} color of the object
is multiplied by the \code{specular} color of the 
light and a constant depending on the \code{shininess}
of the object and the direction to the light, and
added.  The \code{shininess} property mainly
determines the size of the shiny highlight; adjust
one or both of the \code{specular} colors to change
its brightness.}
}

}
}
}
  
  The \code{polygon_offset} property is a two element
vector giving the \samp{factor} and \samp{units} values
to use in a \code{glPolygonOffset()} call in OpenGL.  If
only one value is given, it is used for both elements.
The \samp{units} value is added to the depth of all pixels in
a filled polygon,
and the \samp{factor} value is multiplied by an estimate of
the slope of the polygon and then added to the depth.  Positive values \dQuote{push} polygons back slightly for the purpose
of depth testing, to allow points, lines or other polygons
to be drawn on the surface without being obscured due 
to rounding error.  Negative values pull the object forward.
A typical value to use is \code{1} (which
is automatically expanded to \code{c(1,1)}).
If values are too large, objects which should be behind
the polygon will show through, and if values are too small,
the objects on the surface will be partially obscured. 
Experimentation may be needed to get it right.  The first
example in \code{?\link{persp3d}} uses this property to add 
grid lines to a surface.
  
  \code{material3d} is the recommended interface to the material properties, modelled after
\code{\link{par3d}}:  unspecified parameters, 
will be left unchanged, whereas \code{rgl.material}
will set them to the defaults shown above.  
\code{material3d} may also be used to query the material
properties; see the examples below.

  The \code{material} member of the \code{\link{r3dDefaults}} list may be used to 
set default values for material properties.
  
  The \code{...} parameter to \code{rgl.material} is ignored.
}
\value{
Users should use \code{material3d()} to set and query material properties.  It returns values similarly
to \code{\link{par3d}} as follows:
When setting properties, it returns the previous values in a named list.  A named list is also
returned when more than one value is queried.  When a single value is queried it is returned 
directly.

\code{rgl.material()} is called for the side effect of setting the material properties.
It returns a value invisibly which is not intended for use by the user.
} 
\note{
  If \code{point_antialias} is \code{TRUE}, points will be drawn as circles in WebGL; otherwise, they
will be drawn as squares.  Within R, the behaviour depends
on your graphics hardware:  for example, I see circles for 
both settings on my laptop.

Within R, lines tend to appear heavier with \code{line_antialias == TRUE}.  There's no difference at all
in WebGL.
