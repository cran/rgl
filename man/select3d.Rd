\title{ Select a rectangle in an RGL scene }
\description{
  This function allows the user to use the mouse to
  select a region in an RGL scene.  
}
\usage{
rgl.select3d(button = c("left", "middle", "right"),
             dev = cur3d(), subscene = currentSubscene3d(dev))
select3d(...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{ button }{ Which button to use for selection.}
  \item{ dev, subscene}{ The rgl device and subscene to work with }
  \item{ ... }{ Button argument to pass to \code{rgl.select3d}}
}

\details{
    
This function selects 3-dimensional regions by allowing the
user to use a mouse to draw a rectangle showing
the projection of the region onto the screen.  It returns
a function which tests points for inclusion in the selected region.

If the scene is later moved or rotated, the selected region will 
remain the same, no longer corresponding to a rectangle on the screen.
  
}
\value{
Returns a function \code{f(x, y, z)} which tests whether each
of the points \code{(x, y, z)} is in the selected region, returning
a logical vector.  This function accepts input in a wide
variety of formats as it uses \code{\link[grDevices]{xyz.coords}} 
to interpret its parameters.
